# Brain Tumour Recognition Using CNN Architecture

## Project Description

The Brain Tumour Recognition project addresses the critical task of classifying the type of tumour in brain MRI scans, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. By developing a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, this project aims to accurately identify and categorize different types of brain tumours, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Key Features of the Project

### CNN Architecture
The model utilizes a deep learning approach with Convolutional Neural Networks, designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

### Data Handling
MRI scans of the brain are preprocessed and augmented to improve the model's robustness and generalization capability. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure unbiased performance evaluation.

### Training Techniques
- **Early Stopping**: To prevent overfitting, the training process includes an early stopping mechanism, halting training when the validation accuracy ceases to improve, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Checkpointing**: Model checkpoints are saved at various stages during training. This allows for recovery and continuity in case of interruptions, and provides the best performing model based on validation accuracy.
- **Learning Rate Reduction**: The learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on validation accuracy, reducing when the accuracy plateaus to fine-tune the model for better performance.

### Performance Metrics
The model's efficacy is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of its classification capabilities.

### Implementation and Tools
The project is implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, ensuring efficient and scalable model development and deployment.

### Usage
1. Preprocess and augment the MRI scan dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
3. Train the CNN model using the training set, implementing early stopping, checkpointing, and learning rate reduction.
4. Evaluate the model using the validation and test sets.
5. Use the trained model to classify new MRI scans.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring comprehensive assessment and reliability in brain tumour classification.
